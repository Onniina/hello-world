# hello-world

Hi there!

Finally, after 15 years of working with Matlab m-files, I am ready to start coding with Python also. Machine Learning is something that I a 
am practizing at the moment. However, I have been lucky to find out that actually Machine learning is something I have done already 15 
years ago, but then it was not named ML, but instead inverse problem solving, modelling, and mathematics. Thus, studying ML has been quite 
quick and easy for me. Python, new syntax, and new development environments are new to me, and I am pretty excited learning to use these 
also.
